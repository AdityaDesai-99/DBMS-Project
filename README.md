# Database Management System Project

- This project was made using Java Swing as a frontend and MySQL as a backend.

- It is a simple GUI desktop application that work locally and does the following. 
  - Students can upload files (just the file locations on disk).
  - Teachers can add assignments and view student's solutions (file locations)


PS: Didn't have much time in hand to make it online and to actually upload complete files ;_;
